# 🧩 SliceWise – MVP Data Model

The model supports founder/team ownership, SAFE investment simulation, and dynamic equity visualization for startup users.

---

## 📦 Data Structures

### 1. `teamMembers`

> Represents founders or early team members who hold equity.

```ts
{
  id: string,           // UUID or generated index
  name: string,         // e.g., "Nova"
  shares: number        // e.g., 1000000
}
```

### 2. `safeInvestor`

> Optional: one SAFE investor allowed in MVP.

```ts
{
  id: string,
  name: string,          // e.g., "Angel #1"
  amount: number,        // in USD, e.g., 250000
  valuationCap: number   // e.g., 4000000 (4M post-money cap)
}
```

### 3. `round`

> Optional: one priced round input to simulate dilution.

```ts
{
  amountRaised: number,      // e.g., 1000000
  preMoneyValuation: number  // e.g., 5000000
}
```

### 4. `capTable`

> Derived data — computed from `teamMembers`, `safeInvestor`, and/or `round`.

```ts
{
  name: string,
  shares: number,
  percent: number     // % ownership, rounded to 2 decimals
}[]
```

### 5. `explanations`

> ELI5 messages generated by AI Copilot or local logic.

```ts
{
  action: string,        // e.g., "Added SAFE Investor"
  message: string        // e.g., "The SAFE investor is promised ~6.25% of your company."
}
```

### 6. `chatHistory`

> Stores AI Copilot interactions.

```ts
{
  question: string,
  response: string,
  timestamp: Date
}[]
```

## 🧠 Notes for Computation

### 🧮 SAFE Conversion Logic (Post-Money)

* Formula: `SAFE Shares = amount / (valuationCap / totalOutstandingShares)`
* Add SAFE shares to total before computing %s
* Recompute all ownership %s after any change

### 📊 Charting

* Use `capTable` to generate pie chart slices
* Sort by descending % or preserve order of entry

### 🔁 Reactions

* Any change in `teamMembers`, `safeInvestor`, or `round` triggers recompute of `capTable` and `explanations`
* AI Copilot gets full snapshot of current cap table when prompted

## 🧪 Future Extensions (Post-MVP)

* Add `esopPool` field (as % of total post-money)
* Support multiple rounds and convertible notes
* Add `scenarioSnapshots[]` for saving/shareability
* Add `userSession` or `projectName` for persistent usage
